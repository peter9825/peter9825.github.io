    <p>My name is Peter Pignatone, I am a transfer student from BCC and I'm currently a junior at <br> Bridgewater State University studying Computer Science, I was originally a business major<br>but wasn't enthusiastic about the work I was doing. A friend of mine introduced coding to me <br> and after learning the basics from a few online programs I decided to switch my major and <br> the rest was history! I love to code because it allows me to be creative, solve challenging <br> problems, and build useful technologies.
